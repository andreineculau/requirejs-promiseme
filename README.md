# requirejs-promise

Load async modules that return Promises.

This project is a fork of https://github.com/asengupta/requirejs-q
based on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/requirejs/DW9A6VxwbA0 .

You get a
* a RequireJS plugin to load modules which returns an object that smells like a promises.
* an AMD module that fakes a promise interface, in case you don't want to load a Promise library.
